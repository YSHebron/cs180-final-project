    "# Exploring the Relationship between Air Quality and COVID-19 Infections\n",
    "For this project, our goal is to investigate a **possible** relationship between Air Quality and COVID-19 Infection Rates. To that end, we merged an Air Quality dataset with a COVID-19 dataset, performed preprocessing before and after the merge, trained a regression model on the merged dataset, and performed predictions to test the accuracy of our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an exploration, we attempted to exhaust all relevant regression models whose parameters have been appropriately tuned (if possible), from Support Vector Machines to Linear Regressors (we settled with the latter). All relevant preprocessing steps, from data cleaning, feature renaming and imputation, to pruning, feature selection and standardization, have also been taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify our scope, we have focused only on California Air Quality and COVID-19 datasets, putting a geographical restriction on our approach. The time-series data were sourced directly from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the California State Government respectively. This choice of going abroad is motivated by the difficulty of procuring day-to-day Air Quality and COVID-19 data from the Philippines. We require day-to-day data for a more granular training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because our preprocessed dataset only holds continuous quantitative values, regression is the most appropriate modeling approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** Because this is an exploratory project, we are not absolutely certain that there exists a significant relationship between Air Quality and COVID-19 datasets. Furthermore, our results, significant or not, can only lend support to hypotheses surrounding Air Quality and COVID-19."

    "## Importing and Assessing the Datasets\n",
    "Let us look at the samples, features, and other details regarding the dataset so that we better know what we're dealing with.

    "\n",
    "Note that the reason we started with dataset fragments for Dataset A is because downloading the datasets by year, by state, and then by pollutant type is the only way to do so in the EPA website."
